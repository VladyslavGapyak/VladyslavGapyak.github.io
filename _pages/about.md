I am Vladyslav, a mathematician with a passion for applications. In my PhD project I develop algorithms for the imaging reconstruction problem in Magnetic Particle Imaging for both the model-based and system-matrix-based approaches. For a list of publications, click [here](/vladyslavgapyak/publications/).
I approach this problem using both classical and machine-learning-driven methods.

I am a member of the [ACIDA Lab](https://fbmn.h-da.de/acida)-Algorithms for Computer Vision, Imaging and Data Analysis.
