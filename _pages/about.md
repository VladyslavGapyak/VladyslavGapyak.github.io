I am Vladyslav, a mathematician with a passion for applications. In my PhD project I develop algorithms for the imaging reconstruction problem in Magnetic Particle Imaging for both the model-based and system-matrix-based approaches. For a list of publications, click on [publications page](/vladyslavgapyak/publications/)
I approach this problem using both classical and machine-learning-driven methods.
